Project introduction：

Watching movies has become a popular hobby at this moment. People would like to go to the cinema or watch movies at home in leisure time. However, there are so many types of movies and they are uneven in quality. Finding favorites films effectively in a short time has become to a challenge for majority of people. A more efficient web application is required to query movie information and select movies for users.

After watching the film, people desire to communicate and share their opinions with others about it. Meanwhile, films could be interpreted in different aspects and others’ view of the movie can also broaden the thinking. Therefore, the online platform is required to review movies for users. In addition, moviegoers will get critical thoughts from the film review.

Overall, based on the demand, we decide to build a web application about movie which would provide a number of functions, such as movie searching, movie reviewing and movie recommendation, etc. This document describes the specific requirements of this web application.
